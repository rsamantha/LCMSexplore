### Exploring the data table with Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

This demo allows you to explore the RUBUS dataset (available from Metabolights with ID: MTBLS333). The dataset contains the untargeted measure of 13 red rubus samples and 12 yellow rubus samples. The aim of the study was to characterize the metabolic differences between red and yellow berries (with a special focus on yellow).

Some question to orient your discussion ...

* What is the meaning of the plots? 
* Is the imputing strategy affecting the data distribution? 
* Is it important to consider class labels?
* Which is the best imputing strategy?
